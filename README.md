## Overview

This Jupyter notebook implements a comprehensive jigsaw puzzle solver that can automatically reconstruct square jigsaw puzzles from individual piece images. The solver uses advanced computer vision techniques including LAB color space analysis, asymmetric dissimilarity measures, and greedy placement algorithms.

## Recommended Environment

**‚≠ê We strongly recommend running this notebook on Google Colab** for the best experience. The notebook includes Google Colab-specific features and the environment comes pre-configured with most required dependencies.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Piece Representation**: Efficient piece class with rotation support and boundary color caching
- **Image Splitting**: Automatic splitting of source images into square puzzle pieces
- **Rotation Handling**: Support for pieces with unknown orientations (0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞)
- **Color Space Conversion**: LAB color space for improved color perception accuracy

### Algorithm Components
- **Dissimilarity Calculation**: An asymmetric dissimilarity formula
- **Compatibility Measures**: Edge compatibility analysis between adjacent pieces
- **Best Buddy Detection**: Mutual compatibility relationships
